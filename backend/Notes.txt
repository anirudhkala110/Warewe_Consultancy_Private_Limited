In this project i am using nodejs for the bakend and created the APIs as follow

1 - Registeration for admin : app.post - '/api/register' : requirements-> const { name, email, password, cpassword } = req.body
2 - Login for admin : app.post - '/api/login' : requirements-> const { email, password } = req.body
3 - Get all data saved in Updates Table in the database : app.get - '/api/getAllUpdates'
4 - Deleting the Data present in the Updates Table and also need the authentic person to delete the data, if you want to make it public just remove the checkAdminAuth
    : app.delete - '/api/resources/:selectedResourceId', checkAdminAuth, async (req, res)
5 - Updating the data already present in the Updates table in the database, only authentic person can delete, and if you want to make it public then remove the checkAdminAuth
    : app.post - '/api/saveUpdate', checkAdminAuth,
6 - Logout from the system : app.get - '/api/logout'

These is the basic APIs which can directly work through the postman or whatever you wants to use but make sure to remove the "checkAdminAuth",
so then their is no any authentication error while uploading the data.

Also I am using MySQL for the database, but if you want me to use mongodb then i am provide you the another code with upgrades.

Also include the dotenv file to provide the variable values such as:
DATABASE = Database_name_by_which_you_had_created_Database_in_MySQL
HOST = localhost
USER = root
PASS = Your_MySQL_Password
PORT = 8096
JWT_SECRET_KEY = Your_Own_screate_token_key


## To run this project you just need to run following commands

#### npm install
Install Every module

#### nodemon index.js or npm index.js
to run the server 

##Now all the APIs are active to perform your operation.
